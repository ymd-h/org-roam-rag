;;; Commentary:
;; This package provides RAG functionalities over org-roam files using LLM.
;; This package calls LLM through ahyatt/llm <https://github.com/ahyatt/llm>,
;; so that you need to set one of the llm providers to `org-roam-rag-llm-provider'.


;;; Code:
(require 'llm)
(require 'org-roam)
